### Update 2021/12/7 (Rigel)
- Cleaning up messy codes
- Starting to implement ViewModels

- !!! NOT WORKING YET

### After 2021/12/4
- This project will be maintained by Rigel Vibi Ramadhan
- MVVM architecture will be implemented
- There will be improvements in UI/UX
- Constant updates can be expected

### Before 2021/12/4

  - Daffa Syahdilla (UI/UX Designer)
  - Saifulloh Achmad (UI/UX Designer)
  - Rigel Vibi Ramadhan (App Designer and Programmer)
